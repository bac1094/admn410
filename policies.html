<h3>Policies</h3>
<p>
<h4><u>Financing</u></h4>
</p>

<p>
	SeaSmart collects all of its materials off of public beaches along the South Shore. The profit gained from exporting these materials to other companies, as well as individual purchases, is used to support production 
and employee salaries. The cost of our products reflects the time spent gathering our seaweed and the necessary refinement processes. SeaSmart understands the importance of investing in other eco-freindly practices and is interested
more in the long term benefits of such business endeavors than short term profits.
At the end of each year, SeaSmart donates half of its earnings to support other environmental projects. 
</p>

<h4><u>Delivery</u></h4>
<p>
	Orders are competed the same day they are placed, and are available to be delivered within 24 hours of the request. Times may vary based on number of orders recieved in a day or the time of year.
Winter orders may take longer to complete due to shorter supply and increased vacation time for holiday affairs. SeaSmart is available worldwide. Cost of shipping equates to the extra materials needed to 
package a specific order, as SeaSmart uses their own products to ship their orders, ensuring completely environmentally friendly business functions.

</p>

<h4><u>Return Policies</u></h4>
<p>Returns are acepted up to <b>30 days</b> after shipment for orders <b> under $500 </b>. SeaSmart does not offer returns to large corporate orders. If you are unhappy
with your order, please get in touch with one of our <a href="employees.html">team members</a>.
