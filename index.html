<h4>History</h4>
</p>

<p>
	SeaSmart was founded in 2019 by Brooke Conroy and her father Douglas Conroy. 
Their goal was to create an effective, feasible, eco-friendly alternative to plastic packaging. Noticing the abundance of plastic wrapping, containers, and single use sheets, the two began working to come up with a sustainable solution.
Inspired during a walk on the beach in their sea-side town, the two began working to make various sizes of flattened and refined seaweed that could be used to wrap small items such as jewelry, clothing, and stationary. Coining the name SeaSmart,
 the business expanded to include production of boxes and enclosed containers by layering the seaweed to increase its durability. As SeaSmart continued to grow, larger companies such as

Gaining success and experience, SeaSmart further expanded to include a line of kitchen ware such as utensils, plates, and cups, as well
 as reusable shopping bags. By 2021, SeaSmart's packaging had been used to complete millions of shipments all over the world. SeaSmart intends to continue its venture by experimenting with more possibilities for eco-friendly packaging. Currently, SeaSmart 
is working towards developing a seaweed-based packaging tape, which would allow packages to be completely plastic free.
